## Strategy
- [ ] Upon setting up observers, instantiate them, but don't rush to load the classes they observe. instead, hook into those by monitoring the inherit callbacks of `Active*::Base`
  - [ ] This means observers specify their classes with symbols or strings. *NOT* constants.
- [ ] ObserverArray should *only* store Observer instances. No need to store observer classes at all. (Can create a delegator to helpful methods in the class.)

## TODO
- [ ] Probably a better idea to change functionality since this is a major version change rather than have deprecators strewn all over the place.
- [ ] I have a strong bias for `prepend` nowadays. Check to see if when I use `prepend` it's really preferable over `include`/`extend`.
- [ ] Document all changes (especially non-breaking ones).
- [ ] Optimize autoloading, etc. (Perhaps last?)
- [ ] Writeup upgrade instructions (noting backwards-incompatible changes).
  - [ ] Perhaps write an upgrade generator(?)
- [ ] Cause deprecator to raise errors in testing mode.
- [ ] Add tests for any new functionality you write

## Summary of Changes
- Added Bundler confifiguration setting to make `:github` source in `Gemfile` use `HTTPS`. (Was triggering warning with latest Bundler.)
- Restructured directories and code locations so that it would make intuitive sense (and also so that code would be compatible with autoloaders without manual `require`s or additional configuration).
- Removed reliance on `rails` and `railties` gems.
